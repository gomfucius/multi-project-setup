# multi-project-setup
Proof of concept for multiple project/targets based on workspace and xcodeproj

Open `Main.xcworkspace` to compile the MultiTargetSetup.app.
Open `Sub.xcworkspace` to compile the Sub.app.

These two workspaces build two different targets, but they share common folder `MultiTargetSetup`.
